# ðŸ“¦ Offshore

Offshore is a simple and ergonomic data persistence mechanism for small-scale Python (3.7+) projects and scripts. You can use Offshore to persist state between runs or expose data to other Python tasks.

# Installation

You can install this package using `pip` or build it from source using `poetry`:

    # Using pip
    pip install offshore

    # Using poetry
    pip install poetry
    poetry build

# Snapshots

```python
from offshore import Offshore, Exportable
from typing import Any

state = Offshore()  # Initialise the state container
standard: Any = "hello_world"
special: Exportable = "magic"

state.snapshot()
standard = "brave_new_world"
special = "sorcery"

state.restore()
assert standard == "brave_new_world"  # The regular variable (correctly) remains changed
assert special == "magic"             # The exportable variable is (correctly) restored
```

# Manual Use

```python
from offshore import Offshore

state = Offshore()  # Initialise the state container

# Item-based usage
state["key"] = "value"
assert state["key"] == "value"

# Attribute-based usage
state.key = "value"
assert state.key == "value"

# Persist state
state.dump()

# Mutate local state
state["key"] = "new_value"

# Recover state
state.load()

# Confirm recovery
assert state["key"] == "value"
```

# Autosave

```python
from offshore import Offshore

state = Offshore(autosave=True)  # Initialise the state container
state["key"] = "value"

# Unrelated program

from offshore import Offshore

state = Offshore(autosave=True)  # Initialise the state container
assert state["key"] == "value"
```

# Autoload

```python
from offshore import Offshore

state = Offshore(autoload=True)  # Initialise the state container
state["key"] = "value"

# Unrelated program mutates state
# Key `key` is set to `new_value`

assert state["key"] == "new_value"
```
